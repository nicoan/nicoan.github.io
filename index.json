[{"content":"Ownership and move semantics is one of the things that makes Rust unique. To understand this topic, you need to understand what Stack and Heap are at a basic level. I wrote a post about that! You can check it out if you need a refresher on those concepts. It is a little bit hard to get used to this feature because it forces you to think about stuff that you didn\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about in other languages. Enough introduction, let\u0026rsquo;s cut to the chase!\nThe three rules of ownership There are three rules that governs the ownership system:\nEvery initialized value has an owner: Every initialized value has a variable that is its owner.¹ There is only one owner per value: You can\u0026rsquo;t have two or more variables that owns the same value in memory. You can\u0026rsquo;t share ownership between variables.² If a variable\u0026rsquo;s scope ends, its value gets freed: When a scope ends, all values owned by variables contained in that scope get automatically freed. ¹ But not every variable owns a value, they may just hold a reference. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk about this in the \u0026ldquo;References and Borrowing\u0026rdquo; article. ² Actually you can have more than one owner in safe Rust. You have to use special structures, such as Rc (multiple owners do not own the value directly though).\nLet\u0026rsquo;s test the rules! But before that, a little reminder of how the String type is represented in memory:\nwhere:\nptr: A pointer to the first direction of the Heap containing the string itself (in this case hello). len: How much memory, in bytes, the contents of the string is currently using. capacity: The total amount of memory, in bytes, allocated for that string. GDB In this post, I am going to explore what is happening in memory using the GNU Debugger (gdb) with the special command rust-gdb:\n$ rust-gdb ./target/debug/move_semantics I am going to use the x command a lot to explore the stack and the $sp value (refers to the Stack Pointer).\nRule 1: Every initialized value has an owner. Consider the following code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 fn hello_world() -\u0026gt; u32 { String::from(\u0026#34;hello! I am a free initialized String!\u0026#34;); println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, 42); 42 } fn main() { hello_world(); } In the hello_world function, we have an initialized String value that is free (not assigned to a variable). Did Rust initialize the value in memory or just ignore it? We can\u0026rsquo;t use it so\u0026hellip; Why would Rust save it? Let\u0026rsquo;s check what happens! When we compile this code we get the following warning:\nwarning: unused return value of `from` that must be used --\u0026gt; src/main.rs:2:5 | 2 | String::from(\u0026#34;hello! I am a free initialized String!\u0026#34;); | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ | = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default Rust warns us that we must use the returned value of the String::from function, otherwise, we can\u0026rsquo;t access it in any way. What happens in memory? Let\u0026rsquo;s check it out with GDB!\nFirst, we set a breakpoint at the begginning of the hello_world function and execute the String initialization:\nBreakpoint 1, move_semantics::hello_world () at src/main.rs:2 2 String::from(\u0026#34;hello! I am a free initialized String!\u0026#34;); (gdb) n 3 println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, 42); At this point, the String is initialized, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t assigned to a variable. So, it has no owner! Let\u0026rsquo;s check the stack:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 (gdb) x/80ub $sp 0x7fffffffd980: 0 240 127 255 255 127 0 0 0x7fffffffd988: 61 60 87 85 85 85 0 0 0x7fffffffd990: 16 90 90 85 85 85 0 0 0x7fffffffd998: 38 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0x7fffffffd9a0: 38 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0x7fffffffd9a8: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0x7fffffffd9b0: 48 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0x7fffffffd9b8: 96 255 255 255 255 255 255 255 0x7fffffffd9c0: 0 240 127 255 255 127 0 0 0x7fffffffd9c8: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 It seems that the String value is there, lines 4 to 6 looks like our initialized value: memory addresses 0x7fffffffd998 and 0x7fffffffd9a0 (lines 5 and 6) have a 38 stored, and the string happens to have 38 characters. 0x7fffffffd990 (line 4) must be the Heap address where the actual text is allocated!

But, it appears that the beginning of it was overwritten. It\u0026rsquo;s ok, that value isn\u0026rsquo;t owned by any variable; we can\u0026rsquo;t access it. So, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter what happens to it.\nNOTE: This memory exploration was done using a debug build. I am not really sure what happens if this code was compiled in release mode. I believe that Rust does not initialize the value as an optimization, because it is not used.\nRule 2: There\u0026rsquo;s only one owner per value Consider the following code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 fn main() { // Create a new value, with s1 as owner let s1 = String::from(\u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34;); // Move ownership from s1 to s2 let s2 = s1; // Oops! compiler error, the value has been moved! println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s1); } When we try to compile this, we get:\nerror[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1` --\u0026gt; src/main.rs:7:20 | 3 | let s1 = String::from(\u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34;); | -- move occurs because `s1` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait 4 | // Move ownership from s1 to s2 5 | let s2 = s1; | -- value moved here 6 | // Oops! compiler error, the value has been moved! 7 | println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s1); | ^^ value borrowed here after move What is happening here is that the ownership of the String \u0026quot;hello world!\u0026quot; is transferred from s1 to s2. Because of that, the compiler invalidates the access to s1.\nThe value was moved because the type String does not implement the Copy trait. This is used on types that can be fully allocated in the stack and can be duplicated by simply copying bits without much overload (duplicating data in the Heap is much more complicated). When a type implements the Copy trait, instead of having \u0026ldquo;move semantics\u0026rdquo; it has \u0026ldquo;copy semantics\u0026rdquo;. This is usally the case for primitive types:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 fn main() { let n1 = 42; let n2 = n1; println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, n1); println!(\u0026#34;{} {}\u0026#34;, n1, n2); } If we run this code\u0026hellip;\ncargo run Compiling move_semantics v0.1.0 (/home/rust/blog) Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s Running `target/debug/move_semantics` 42 42 42 compiles! Because the value 42 is copied!\nRule 3: If a variable\u0026rsquo;s scope ends its value gets freed Consider the following code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 fn main() { { // Create a new value with s1 as owner let s1 = String::from(\u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34;); } // s1 gets dropped here! since is the end of the scope println!(\u0026#34;Checking drop with gdb!\u0026#34;); } s1 allocation will have been freed when we reach line 7. This is because the curly braces at the beggining of the main function creates a new scope. Once the code reaches the end of it, all the variables that it contained get dropped. Let\u0026rsquo;s check it out in GDB:\nOn line 4, we can find s1 in the locals variables of the scope:\nBreakpoint 1, move_semantics::main () at src/main.rs:4 4\tprintln!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s1); (gdb) info locals s1 = \u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34; Let\u0026rsquo;s check where the Heap allocation of s1 is and what value it contains (remember that the first field of the Stack representation is the pointer to the Heap):\n(gdb) p \u0026amp;s1 $1 = (*mut alloc::string::String) 0x7fffffffd960 (gdb) x/xg 0x7fffffffd960 0x7fffffffd960:\t0x00005555555a5ad0 (gdb) x/12c 0x00005555555a5ad0 0x5555555a5ad0:\t104 \u0026#39;h\u0026#39;\t101 \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;\t108 \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;\t108 \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;\t111 \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;\t32 \u0026#39; \u0026#39;\t119 \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;\t111 \u0026#39;o\u0026#39; 0x5555555a5ad8:\t114 \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;\t108 \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;\t100 \u0026#39;d\u0026#39;\t33 \u0026#39;!\u0026#39; But when the scope finishes\u0026hellip;\n7\tprintln!(\u0026#34;Checking drop with gdb!\u0026#34;); (gdb) info locals No locals.

That part of the Heap is now filled with something else (probably garbage).\nMoving a value: What happens under the hood? Consider the following code:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 fn move_stack_example() { // Create a new String value let s1 = String::from(\u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34;); // Move it from s1 to s2 (s2 takes ownership) let s2 = s1; println!(\u0026#34;{}\u0026#34;, s2); } fn main() { move_stack_example(); } When we move a value, it does not dissapears from the memory, instead, whatever is in the stack that belongs to the moved value gets duplicated and the compiler just forbids us from accessing the old variable ever again.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s verify what I just said with GDB. We are going to examine the stack frame of the move_stack_example function. First of all, let\u0026rsquo;s check the locals variables:\n(gdb) info locals s2 = \u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34; s1 = \u0026#34;hello world!\u0026#34; Whoa! Looks like s1 and s2 have the same value! Actually they are pointing to the same value. Let\u0026rsquo;s now see what the addresses of s1 and s2 are:\n(gdb) p \u0026amp;s1 $1 = (*mut alloc::string::String) 0x7fffffffdb08 (gdb) p \u0026amp;s2 $2 = (*mut alloc::string::String) 0x7fffffffdb20 Great! Now, we know that s1\u0026rsquo;s stack representation starts at 0x7fffffffdb08 and s2\u0026rsquo;s starts at 0x7fffffffdb20. Let\u0026rsquo;s now see the contents of the stack frame:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 (gdb) x/80bu $sp 0x7fffffffdaf0:\t112\t171\t217\t247\t255\t127\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdaf8:\t7\t125\t221\t247\t255\t127\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb00:\t2\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb08:\t208\t90\t90\t85\t85\t85\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb10:\t12\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb18:\t12\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb20:\t208\t90\t90\t85\t85\t85\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb28:\t12\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb30:\t12\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0 0x7fffffffdb38:\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0\t0 What do we have at s1 and s2 addresses? Let\u0026rsquo;s check it out!:\nptr: For s1 this value is at 0x7fffffffdb08. For s2 this value is at 0x7fffffffdb20. len: For s1 this value is at 0x7fffffffdb10. For s2 this value is at 0x7fffffffdb28. capacity: For s1 this value is at 0x7fffffffdb18. For s2 this value is at 0x7fffffffdb30. As you can see, both ptr values are the same, meaning that both variables are pointing to the same data in the Heap. Let\u0026rsquo;s print them in hexadecimal to get the correct format to explore it:\n(gdb) x/xg 0x7fffffffdb08 0x7fffffffdb08: 0x00005555555a5ad0 (gdb) x/xg 0x7fffffffdb20 0x7fffffffdb20: 0x00005555555a5ad0 So, the ptr value is 0x00005555555a5ad0! Now, take a look at the contents of that address in the Heap:\n(gdb) x/12c 0x00005555555a5ad0 0x5555555a5ad0:\t104 \u0026#39;h\u0026#39;\t101 \u0026#39;e\u0026#39;\t108 \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;\t108 \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;\t111 \u0026#39;o\u0026#39;\t32 \u0026#39; \u0026#39;\t119 \u0026#39;w\u0026#39;\t111 \u0026#39;o\u0026#39; 0x5555555a5ad8:\t114 \u0026#39;r\u0026#39;\t108 \u0026#39;l\u0026#39;\t100 \u0026#39;d\u0026#39;\t33 \u0026#39;!\u0026#39; The hello world! string is there!\nConclusion It can take some time to get used to working with ownership and move semantics, but, in my opinion, that is well invested time. Manually mananging memory (by allocating and freeing it) is not an easy task and can create several bugs. With Rust\u0026rsquo;s approach, those bugs are caught at compile time, so they can never happen!\nIf you want to read more about this topic, check out the Rust book.\n","permalink":"https://nicoan.github.io/posts/move_semantics/","summary":"Ownership and move semantics is one of the things that makes Rust unique.

I want to improve my writing skills so, I decided to write articles about things I find interesting. This article was supposed to be about how Rust manages memory through ownership. Then I thought \u0026ldquo;I should first write about Stack and Heap\u0026rdquo;. So, here we are :).\nTo understand memory management first, we need to understand what the Stack and the Heap are. Stack and Heap are memory regions used by a process to store and read values. The memory of a running process can usually be divided in the following four regions:\nText: Here is where our program instructions live. Our compiled program is loaded and stored in this region of the memory. Data: All the global variables are stored in this region. Stack: A contiguous chunk of memory that stores local variables, arguments and return addresses of functions (we will go deeper on this in the next section). Every process\u0026rsquo; thread has its own Stack. Heap: Stores all the dynamically allocated memory. This region is shared among all threads of a process. Stack A process\u0026rsquo; Stack is an actual implementation of the Stack data structure. It is fixed in size; we can not ask the operating system for more memory. This size depends mostly on the OS. In modern Linux systems, the maximum Stack size is 8 MB (you can check yours with the command ulimit -s).\nInside the Stack Every time we call a function, a Stack frame (a chunk of contiguous memory containing all the information required by the recently called function) is created and placed on top of the Stack. And, every time a function ends, the Stack frame is popped from the Stack, automatically releasing all the memory used by it. Let\u0026rsquo;s see a minimal example on how the Stack is populated. Consider the following code:\nfn sum(a: i32, b: i32) -\u0026gt; i32 { let result = a + b; result } fn square_sum(a: i32, b: i32) -\u0026gt; i32 { let sum_result = sum(a, b); let pow_result = sum_result * sum_result; pow_result } fn main() { let n1 = 2; let n2 = 5; let pow_result = square_sum(n1, n2); println!(\u0026#34;Result: {}\u0026#34;, pow_result); } The following diagram represents what happens with the Stack when the program is executed:\nAt the beginning, a Stack frame for the main function is created. main calls square_sum, a Stack frame for square_sum is created. square_sum calls sum, a Stack frame is created for sum. After sum is called, its Stack frame is destroyed, releasing automatically all the memory it occupied. After square_sum is called, its Stack frame is destroyed, releasing automatically all the memory it occupied. main prints the result and ends. The operating system frees up all the remaining memory. NOTE: Usually, the stack grow downwards!\nInside the Stack frame The Stack frame is where all the local variables, arguments, and return address (this is used by the running process to know where the next code instruction to be executed is, after the function call ends) of a function live. The good news is that the user does not have to worry about allocating or de-allocating the memory used by it (neither with Heap allocations in safe Rust, but that is for another post). Given that the Stack is fixed in size, we can only store data that its size is known at compile time. For dynamic sized data (such as vectors), Heap memory is used (only a pointer to that part of the Heap memory and maybe some metadata is saved into the Stack). Let\u0026rsquo;s expand the above Stack diagrams to show the stack frame of each function:\nHow do we use the memory contained in the frame? We have two pointers that helps us with that:\nStack Pointer (SP): Always points at the top of the Stack. When a Stack frame is created the new SP\u0026rsquo;s value is SP + size_of(new_Stack_frame). It will change any time a value is pushed onto or popped off the stack. When an executing function returns, it goes back to its previous size. Base Pointer (BP): Also known as Frame Pointer (FP). Points to the base of the current Stack frame. When a Stack frame is created, the BP gets the value SP had before adding the size of the new Stack frame. The BP is used to access the arguments and local variables of a function by adding/substracting the offset of the variable we want to access. For example, if we want to access the argument y, we need to read the address BP + 12 because, first, we have the return address that (let\u0026rsquo;s assume) is 4 bytes long, and then the argument x that is a 32 bits integer (4 bytes). The layout presented here is just an example. Although, in reality, the frames contain the same information, how the data is organized depends on the machine architecture and the application binary interface (ABI).\nThis StackOverflow answer shows how the frame is constructed using x86 assembly.\nHeap In this context, \u0026ldquo;Heap\u0026rdquo; has nothing to do with the Heap data structure, it is just a name for the free memory pool.\nThe Heap is not fixed in size. We can ask for more memory, as long as it is available in the system, and free it if the allocated values are not needed anymore. Unlike Stack, when we are working with the Heap we have to take care of the allocation and deallocation of memory (in Rust, most allocation/deallocation logic is hidden behind abstractions). When we use the Heap, we are dynamically allocating memory. This comes in very handy when we are dealing with data which size is unknown at compile time (i.e. user input). In opposition to the Stack, the memory allocations are not sequential.\nWhen a process wants to allocate some chunk of memory of a given size, the operating system first has to search for a free piece of memory with the needed size. After finding it, the OS locks it up (only that particular process can access that portion of the system memory) and returns the starting address of the block. This process leads to memory fragmentation (the data allocated in the Heap is not contiguous).\nWhen we use the Heap, we also store some data in the Stack (at least a pointer to the allocated data). Consider the following code:\nfn main() { let n1: Box\u0026lt;u8\u0026gt; = Box::new(42); let my_string = String::from(\u0026#34;hello\u0026#34;); println!(\u0026#34;{} {}\u0026#34;, my_string, n1); } NOTE: A Box is a smart pointer to a heap allocated value.\nThe following diagram shows the allocations made in the Stack and the Heap:\nWriting and reading the Heap is slower than writing and reading the Stack for several reasons:\nFor memory allocation, a process has to make a system call and wait for the OS to complete the process described above. Using the allocated memory (for writing or reading) involves at least one indirection (following the pointer allocated in the Stack). Under the right conditions, a program can be optimized to store some parts of the Stack inside the processor\u0026rsquo;s cache, making writing/reading operations blazingly fast. Summary Stack Heap Fixed in size Can grow or shrink Allocations are in a contiguous block Allocation happens in \u0026ldquo;random\u0026rdquo; order Faster access time Slower access time Is thread local by default: every thread of a process has its own Stack. Can be used to share memory across threads ","permalink":"https://nicoan.github.io/posts/stack_and_heap/","summary":"Why write about Stack and Heap when there are already a lot of articles out there? I want to improve my writing skills so, I decided to write articles about things I find interesting. This article was supposed to be about how Rust manages memory through ownership. Then I thought \u0026ldquo;I should first write about Stack and Heap\u0026rdquo;. So, here we are :).\nTo understand memory management first, we need to understand what the Stack and the Heap are.","title":"Stack and Heap"}]
